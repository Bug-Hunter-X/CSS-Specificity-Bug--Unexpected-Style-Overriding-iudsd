The solution involves understanding CSS specificity and either modifying selector specificity or restructuring the CSS to ensure the desired styles are applied correctly. 

Here's one possible approach, modifying the specificity of the selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red;
}

#myDiv {
  color: green;
}

#myDiv.container {
  color: purple; 
}

/*Reduce specificity by removing the div selector.  The style for #myDiv.container should now be used*/
#myDiv.container {
  color: yellow; 
}

```

Another approach involves reorganizing the styles to ensure the intended style is applied. The last rule will be applied. For instance:

```css
/*This selector has high specificity, overriding others*/
#myDiv.container {
  color: yellow; 
}

#myDiv {
  color: green;
}

.container div {
  color: red;
}

div {
  color: blue;
}
```
