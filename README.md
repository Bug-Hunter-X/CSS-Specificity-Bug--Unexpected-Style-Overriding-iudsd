# CSS Specificity Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to CSS specificity and the cascading order of styles. The bug arises from unexpected style overriding due to a selector with high specificity.

## Problem

The `bug.css` file contains CSS code where a highly specific selector unintentionally overrides other, seemingly more relevant styles. This leads to unexpected visual output.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.css` file demonstrates a way to resolve this bug, either by adjusting the specificity of the conflicting selectors or by reorganizing the CSS rules to ensure the desired styles are applied correctly. The solution emphasizes understanding CSS specificity to avoid this type of error.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.html` (or a similar HTML file that uses `bug.css`) in a web browser.
3. Observe the unexpected styling.
4. Compare the results with those from `bugSolution.html` (using `bugSolution.css`) to see the corrected styling.
