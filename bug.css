The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors and the cascading order:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red;
}

#myDiv {
  color: green;
}

#myDiv.container {
  color: purple; 
}

#myDiv.container div { /*This selector has high specificity, overriding others*/
  color: yellow; 
}

```

In this example, the `#myDiv.container div` selector has high specificity and will override all other styles. However, the unexpected behavior might arise if the developer is not aware of this specificity, leading to confusion in debugging.
